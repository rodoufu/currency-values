The application reads the Bitcoin quotation from a Brazilian exchange at:
https://broker.negociecoins.com.br/api/v3/btcbrl/ticker
Then it modifies the data by mixing it with the currencies quotations from:
https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest?base=BRL
Generating a Bitcoin quotation for each currency found.
The data is saved in-memory with H2 the the last 10 entries can be obtained accessing the '/' address using the GET method. 

It is possible to configure the time between each time a Bitcoin quotation is requested,
this can be done on the file 'application.properties' on the property 'bitcoin.price.job.interval',
this value is the amount of milliseconds between two requests.
